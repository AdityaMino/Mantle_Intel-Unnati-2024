# MantleÂ©: A comprehensive Power Management tool designed to monitor and display various system metrics and manage telemetry data in real-time âš¡ðŸ”‹
# PS01: Power Manager Telemetry


In the era of 5G and edge computing, the deployment of devices across different locations,has increased, leading to higher power consumption. To adress this issue corporations and governments worldwide have initiated steps to achieve net-zero power consumption. Additionally, the price of electricity is increasing, making it crucial to understand the total power drawn by the system.  

The main objectives of this project include the following -  
    1. Researching and identifying open-source tools for power measurement.  
    2. Identifying and documenting the available knobs in a system to measure power.  
    3. Collect power telemetry data from CPU, memory, NIC, and TDP etc.  
    4. Measure and record system power utilization for CPU, NIC, and TDP based on the input parameter of system utilization percentage.
